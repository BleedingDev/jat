# Getting Started with JAT

**Get a multi-agent IDE running in 5 minutes.**

JAT (Jomarchy Agent Tools) lets you coordinate multiple AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. The IDE is your command center.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install JAT

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joewinke/jat/master/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Add Your Projects

JAT needs to know about your projects. By default, it scans `~/code/`:

```bash
jat init                    # Auto-discover projects in ~/code/
```

**Custom project paths?** Edit `~/.config/jat/projects.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "name": "MY-APP",
      "path": "~/projects/my-app",
      "port": 3000
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Launch the IDE

```bash
jat                         # Opens http://localhost:3333
```

You'll see:
- **Tasks page** - Your backlog across all projects
- **Work page** - Active agent sessions
- **Agents page** - Agent status and coordination

### 4. Create Your First Task

In the IDE:
1. Click **"+ New Task"**
2. Enter a title and description
3. Set priority (P0 = critical, P2 = normal)
4. Click **Create**

Or via CLI:
```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
bd create "Add user authentication" --priority 1 --type feature
```

### 5. Launch an Agent

```bash
jat my-project                    # Launches: VS Code + default agent harness + IDE (codex-native by default)
# OR (force a harness)
jat my-project --agent codex-native
jat my-project --claude           # Claude Code + /jat:* slash commands
# OR
jat-myproject                     # Shortcut function (generated by install)
```

The agent:
1. Runs inside **tmux** (required for IDE tracking)
2. Starts with a JAT bootstrap prompt (Codex/Codex-native) or runs `/jat:start` (Claude Code)
3. Uses `bd` + `am-*` + `jat-signal` to coordinate and update the IDE

### 6. Watch the Magic

In the IDE **Work** page, you'll see:
- Agent status (working, needs input, ready for review)
- Current task progress
- Real-time signals from agents
- EventStack timeline of agent activity

---

## Launch a Swarm (Multiple Agents)

```bash
jat my-project 4            # Launch 4 sessions using your configured fallback agent
jat my-project 4 --auto     # 4 agents that auto-pick tasks
jat my-project 4 --claude   # Force Claude Code sessions
```

Each agent:
- Gets assigned different tasks (no conflicts)
- Reserves files to prevent collisions
- Coordinates via Agent Mail
- Reports status to IDE

---

## Key Concepts

### One Agent = One Session = One Task

Each agent session handles exactly one task.

Completion:
- **Claude Code:** run `/jat:complete`
- **Codex/Codex-native:** run:

```bash
jat-complete-bundle --task <task-id> --agent <AgentName> --emit
```

This keeps context clean and focused.

### Task Flow

```
Create task (IDE/CLI)
       ↓
Spawn agent (IDE or `jat <project>`)
       ↓
Agent claims task (`bd ready` → `bd update <id> --status in_progress --assignee <AgentName>`)
       ↓
Agent works (code, test, document) + emits `jat-signal` states
       ↓
Review or auto-proceed
       ↓
Completion bundle emitted (`jat-complete-bundle --emit` or `/jat:complete`)
       ↓
Task closed, agent session ends
       ↓
Next task → spawn next agent
```

### Beads Task Sync

Tasks live in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and sync via git:
- You commit → tasks sync to repo
- Teammate pulls → they see your tasks
- Shared backlog across the team

## Common Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `jat` | Launch IDE |
| `jat <project>` | Full dev environment (uses configured fallback agent) |
| `jat <project> --agent <agentId>` | Force a specific agent harness |
| `jat <project> --claude` | Claude Code sessions (slash commands) |
| `jat <project> 4` | Launch 4 agents |
| `jat list` | Show all projects |
| `jat init` | Auto-discover projects |
| `bd ready` | Show tasks ready to work |
| `bd create "Title"` | Create a task |

---

## Tmux Requirement

**Agents MUST run in tmux for IDE tracking.**

The `jat` command handles this automatically. If you want IDE tracking, run agents via `jat <project>` so the session is created inside tmux (instead of launching `codex`, `codex-native`, or `claude` directly).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create some tasks** in the IDE
2. **Launch an agent** with `jat <project>`
3. **Watch the Work page** as agent progresses
4. **Complete a task**: `/jat:complete` (Claude) or `jat-complete-bundle --emit` (Codex/Codex-native)

For full documentation, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Troubleshooting

**IDE won't start?**
```bash
# Find your install location (usually ~/.local/share/jat or ~/code/jat)
cd ~/.local/share/jat/ide   # or ~/code/jat/ide for developers
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Agent shows offline?**
- Not running in tmux. Use `jat <project>` to launch properly.

**Custom project path?**
- Edit `~/.config/jat/projects.json` manually (see step 2 above)

**Tasks not syncing?**
- Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` to git
- Teammate pulls to get updates
